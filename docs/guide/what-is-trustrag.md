# What is TrustRAG?

TrustRAG is a self-contained, multi-platform RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge workbench. It helps you build a private knowledge base, upload documents, ask questions, and — most importantly — inspect the evidence behind each AI answer.

## Why TrustRAG?

Most RAG systems give you an AI-generated answer and maybe a list of "sources." TrustRAG goes further:

- **Every citation is traceable** — linked to a specific document, chunk, page number, and heading path
- **Citations are reviewable** — approve, reject, or flag each citation for accuracy
- **Review history is preserved** — full audit trail for accountability

## Two Modes

### Desktop Mode (Self-Contained)

Download and run. No servers, no databases to configure. TrustRAG bundles a Rust backend and SQLite database inside the app. Available on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

### Server Mode (Full Stack)

For teams that need PostgreSQL vector search, Redis caching, and MinIO file storage. Deploy with Docker Compose.
